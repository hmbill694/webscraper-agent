# webscraper-agent

This is a first pass at this search agent. The approach hardcoded and there is very little reasoning inside the LLM units.

Going to refactor and rethink my approach.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.9. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
